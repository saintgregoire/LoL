## Philosophy

I tried to adhere to two main principles:

* [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
* [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)

I wanted to preserve as much as possible the design and color scheme of the official game website, but at the same time adding my own ideas.

*Some materials were taken from the [official website of the game](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/fr-fr/).*
